Constraints:
-Rule/condition which is applied while creating a table.
-It is not mandatory(but highly recommended)
-Used to restrict the data that are entering into table.
-Here, constraints are applied in column level.
Note:-
-Null means empty space.
-Inside the cell, if we see an empty space, it will be considered as null.
Types of constraints:
1)not null
2)unique
3)Primary key
4)Foreign key
5)check
6)default

1/-not null: Used to avoid null values.
-While inserting the data into the column user must and should pass the values.(it wont take any null values)

2/-unique: It avoids duplicate values.
-User can not insert/store same values into that particular column.
-Unique can take more than one null values on oracle 10g but not on MySQL.(MySQL DB allows only one value for unique column).
		  
3/-Primary Key: Combination of unique and not null.
-For one table we can have only one primary key, more than one primary key is not allowed by the server.
-Used for unique identification of each record.(***)
-Primary Key is not mandatory but highly recommended.
ex: rollno number(4) primary key

4/-Foreign key: Used to build a relation from one table to another table.(to establish some parent-child relation)
-In a table we can have more than one foreign key.
-Foreign Key is also known as referential-integrity constraints.
-Foreign key allows duplicates and null values.
-Primary key of the parent table should be the foreign key in child table.
ex: tid, hid are the foreign key
				
5/-Check:Used to restrict the data that is entering into the table-column.
-It is like a rule given to the particular column, if the rule or given condition is satisfied it allows the data to be stored else it rejects.
ex: phono number(10) check (length(phno)=10)

6/-Default: Used to store the default value for a given column.
ex: Branch varchar2(10) default "MECH"

Create a copy of table.
Syntax:
Create table table-name as select statement;
ex: create table emp1 as select * from emp;

DML(Data Manipulation Language):
-Used to manage and manipulate the data inside the database.
-DML is not directly connecteed to database, so the changes are not permanent.
-DML commands are not auto-commited.
-To make the changes permanent to database we should use TCL.

1)insert: Used to insert the values into the table.
Syntax: 1(if you want store all the values into all the columns for particular row)
insert into table-name values (value1, value2, value3.....);
ex:insert into product1 values (1,'car',1200,12-sep-2022);

syntax2:(if you want to store the values for particular column use syntax2)
insert into table-name (col1, col2, col3.....) values (value1, value2, value3.....) ;
ex: insert into product1 (pid,pname) values(1,bus);

TCL:Used to control the transaction done by the DML statement.
-TCL are applicable only for DML statement.

commit: used to save the data permanently into the database.
syntax: commit;

DQL: Data Query Language
-Used to retreive the data from the Database.
-select : Used to retreive/select the data from the table/database and to display it.
-The returned rows may be set of rows stored in a table called result table or result set.
-To retreive the data we have three different ways:
1)projection
2)selection
3)joins

																	
Projection: Used to retreive the data just by selecting the column is known as projection.
syntax: select */distinct column-name expression/aliasing
        from table-name;
order of execution: 1)from
					2)select
note: * selects all the column, once the column is selcted by default values get selcted.
-If user gives the table-name which is not present in the database, then user gets an error(table/view dosen't exist,)
-If user gives the col-name which is not present in the table, then user gets an error as invalid-identifier.
-Query: its a request sent to database to fetch the required data.

Q1)WAQTD details of employee.
ans- select * from emp;
Q2)WAQTD details of department.
ans- select * from dept;
Q3)WAQTD salgrade details.
ans- select * from salgrade;

Distinct: Used to remove the duplicate in specified column or in table.
-We can include more than one column in one distinct keyword/clause.
-We cannot have more than one distinct in one select statement.
-If the user has a requirement of using distinct, always the distinct should be the 1st argument after the select clause.

Q4)WAQTD employee name and salary of all the employee.
ans- select ename,sal from emp;
Q5)WAQTD employee name, salary, mgr, comm and deptno of all employee.
ans- select ename,sal,mgr,comm,deptno from emp;
Q6)WAQTD unique jobs.
ans- select distinct job from emp;
Q7)WAQTD unique deptno.
ans- select distinct deptno from emp;
Q8)WAQTD unique job, deptno of employee.
ans- select distinct job,deptno from emp;
